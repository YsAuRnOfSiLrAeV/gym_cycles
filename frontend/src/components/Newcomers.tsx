            </li>
            <li>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-poppins font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Warm-up</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 marker:text-[#6a4133]">
            <li>Rotational movements with arms forward and back, elbows, wrists - to warm up shoulder complex.</li>
            <li>Hip tilts forward-back and sideways - for lower back and hip mobilization.</li>
            <li>Rotator cuff stretch (arm across chest, other arm fixes elbow) and chest muscles (in doorway).</li>
            <li>Hamstring stretch (bend to straight leg) and adductor muscles (deep side lunge).</li>
            <li>Isolation exercises in light mode for muscles that will be worked in training (e.g., lateral raises before shoulder press).</li>
            <li>Cardio (optional): 3-7 minutes of walking or running on treadmill, stationary bike or jump rope for general body temperature increase.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-poppins font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Cool-down</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 marker:text-[#6a4133]">
            <li>Light cardio or walking (3-5 minutes) for gradual heart rate reduction.</li>
            <li>Static stretches for main muscle groups that were worked.</li>
            <li>Special attention to lower back extension: lie on stomach and slowly raise chest on straight arms (sphinx or cobra).</li>
          </ul>
    
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-poppins font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">General Recommendations</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 marker:text-[#6a4133]">
            <li>Start with proper technique, not heavy weights. Otherwise, training can lead to serious injuries.</li>
            <li>Warm-up and cool-down are mandatory for injury prevention. It is recommended to follow each point described above on the page.</li>
            <li>Progressive overload is the key to stable development.</li>
            <li>Recovery includes quality sleep, nutrition, and passive rest. Without quality recovery, an athlete, especially natural, will not be able to progress normally.</li>
